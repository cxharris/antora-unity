:navtitle: Animation

Downloading existing animations and their movements (or captured motions) and importing them into Unity is a part of the modern canon of Unity. This section explains the basics of Unity's animation system, and one way to incorporate assets developed outside of Unity. Unity's animation system should not be confused with the animation systems separately available from the Unity Asset Store - either free or at a cost.

=== Mixamo

One place that has a good selection of animations is Adobe's *Mixamo* platform - https://www.mixamo.com. It's a free platform where registered users can download a variety of character models and hundreds of animations. 'Character models' and 'animations' are complex assemblies of simpler components, are first-class abstractions in a Unity context, and are a little slippery initially if you're new to all this.

== Downloading characters and animations from Mixamo
. Log into the Mixamo platform and choose either *Characters* or *Animations* in the top-level menu.

If you select a character, and then an animation, the animation is applied to your chosen character, regardless of the character the animation thumbnail contains.
