Downloading existing animations and their movements (or captured motions) and importing them into Unity is a part of the modern canon of Unity. This section explains the basics of Unity's animation system, and one way to incorporate assets developed outside of Unity. Unity's animation system should not be confused with the animation systems separately available from the Unity Asset Store - either free or at a cost.

=== Mixamo

One place that has a good selection of useful assets is Adobe's *Mixamo* platform - https://www.mixamo.com. It's a free platform where registered users can download a variety of character models and hundreds of animations. 'Character models' and 'animations' are complex assemblies of simpler components, and are a little slippery initially if you're unfamiliar with them. They become more familiar with use.

== Downloading characters and animations from Mixamo
. Log into the Mixamo platform and choose either *Characters* or *Animations* in the top-level menu. A search box below the menu allows you to search for characters or animations when you already know what they are called.

and

. On the *Characters* tab, search for *ybot* and click the relevant thumbnail when the search finishes - the _ybot_ pops up in the right-hand preview pane, where you can review and manipulate it. This action also sets *ybot* as the active character.
+
If you select a character, and then an animation, the animation is applied to your chosen character, regardless of the character the animation thumbnail contains.

. On the *Animations* tab, search for *idle* and select the thumbnail. There are several animations called *idle* - just choose one that appeals.
+
Look carefully and you'll see that even an _idling_ animation contains movement.

. Press *DOWNLOAD* and a modal dialog box pops up:

Complete the dialog:
+
** *Format*: FBX for Unity(.fbx)
+
_.fbx_ files are often used in game development and animation and generally contain 3D models saved in the Autodesk Filmbox format.
** *Skin*: With Skin
+
By selecting *With Skin* we are including the 3D model with the file.
** *Frames per Second*: 30
+ 
All three offered values are acceptable because Unity's animation system uses _interpolation_, which essentially involves estimating animation values between frames. Choosing 30 offers a good compromise between fidelity and output file size.
** *Keyframe Reduction*: None
+
This process removes keyframes if Unity determines that two individual frames are not sufficiently different to warrant the overhead. This actually happens when Unity _imports_ assets, so the animation keyframes you see in Unity have already been reduced. For this exerecise we'll simply choose *None*.
+
Press *DOWNLOAD* to download the idle animation to a known directory on your machine.

. Repeat the above steps to download a _walking_ animation and a _running_ animation. 
+
IMPORTANT: For animations that include movement over the ground - like walking and running - you should check the *In Place* checkbox before downloading - otherwise the characters will move across the scene when you activate them within Unity.
+
This movement isn't necessarily wrong, it's just not what we need at the moment. 
+

. You now have three ybot animations downloaded into a local folder:
+
[#img-downloaded-ybot-animations]
.Downloaded ybot animations

+
The next stage in this workflow is to import these assets into Unity.
