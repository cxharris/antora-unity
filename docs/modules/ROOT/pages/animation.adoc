:navtitle: Animation

Downloading existing animations and their movements (or captured motions) and importing them into Unity is a part of the modern canon of Unity. This section explains the basics of Unity's animation system, and one way to incorporate assets developed outside of Unity. Unity's animation system should not be confused with the animation systems separately available from the Unity Asset Store - either free or at a cost.

=== Mixamo

One place that has a good selection of useful assets is Adobe's *Mixamo* platform - https://www.mixamo.com. It's a free platform where registered users can download a variety of character models and hundreds of animations. 'Character models' and 'animations' are complex assemblies of simpler components, and are a little slippery initially if you're unfamiliar with them. They become more familiar with use.

== Downloading characters and animations from Mixamo
. Log into the Mixamo platform and choose either *Characters* or *Animations* in the top-level menu. A search box below the menu allows you to search for characters or animations when you already know what they are called.

. On the *Characters* tab, search for *ybot* and click the relevant thumbnail when the search finishes - the _ybot_ pops up in the right-hand preview pane, where you can review and manipulate it.
+
If you select a character, and then an animation, the animation is applied to your chosen character, regardless of the character the animation thumbnail contains.

. On the *Animations* tab, search for *idle* and select the thumbnail. There are several animations called *idle* - just choose one that appeals.
+
Look carefully and you'll see that even an _idling_ animation contains movement.
