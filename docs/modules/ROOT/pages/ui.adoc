= Creating a reusable user interface
:navtitle: A reusable Unity UI

== Prototyping the UI structure

. Create an empty GameObject called *UI-base* - this is going to be the ultimate parent of all UI screens - our UI system is going to live on this particular GameObject.
+
This makes what follows much easier to manage.
. Right-click on *UI-base* in the Hierarchy view and choose *UI* > *Canvas* to create a 2D canvas. Leave its render mode as *Screen Space - Overlay*.
+
Here's what your Inspector view of your canvas might look like:
+
[#img-canvas-inspector]
.Setting up your canvas
image::canvas-inspector.png[]
+
. Organise your *Scene* window so that the new canvas is square on in the middle.
. In the *Canvas Scaler* component of the *Canvas* set the *UI Scale Mode* to *Scale With Screen Size*, and set the *Reference Resolution* to 2560x1440.
. Drag the *EventSystem* in the Hierarchy view so that it is a child of *UI-base* - another nod to keeping things organised.
. Right-click *Canvas* and choose *UI* > *Image* to add an image as a child of *Canvas* - rename the image to *background*.
+
You can see that the image is represented by a small white square in the middle of the canvas.
+
[#img-image-added-to-canvas]
.The image is a small square in the middle of the canvas
image::image-added-to-canvas.png[]

. Select *background* in your Hierarchy view and with (most probably) your left hand, hold down all of CTRL SHIFT and ALT (Windows). Look at the background's *Rect Transform* panel and click on the *anchor presets icon*: image:anchor-presets-icon.png[]. Note that the graphic it displays varies, and may not be the same as I have used. 
+
[#img-anchor-presets-icon-location]
.The anchor presets dialog icon
image::anchor-presets-icon-location.png[]
+
The *anchor presets* dialog pops up:
+
[#img-anchor-presets]
.The anchor presets dialog
image::anchor-presets.png[]
. Click the bottom-right selection at the intersection of _stretch_ and _stretch_ (while still holding down CTRL SHIFT and ALT with the other hand).
+
The image stretches to fill the canvas, snapping the anchors to a full stretch.
