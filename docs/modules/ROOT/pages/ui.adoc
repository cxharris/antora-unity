= Creating a reusable user interface
:navtitle: A reusable Unity UI

== Prototyping the UI structure

. Create an empty GameObject called *UI-base* - this is going to be the ultimate parent of all UI screens - our UI system is going to live on this particular GameObject.
+
This makes what follows much easier to manage.
. Right-click on *UI-base* in the Hierarchy view and choose *UI* > *Canvas* to create a 2D canvas. Leave its render mode as *Screen Space - Overlay*.
+
Here's what your Inspector view of your canvas might look like:
+
[#img-canvas-inspector]
.Setting up your canvas
image::canvas-inspector.png[]
+
. Organise your *Scene* window so that the new canvas is square on in the middle.
. In the *Canvas Scaler* component of the *Canvas* set the *UI Scale Mode* to *Scale With Screen Size*, and set the *Reference Resolution* to 2560x1440.
. Drag the *EventSystem* in the Hierarchy view so that it is a child of *UI-base* - another nod to keeping things organised.
. Right-click *Canvas* and choose *UI* > *Image* to add an image as a child of *Canvas* - rename the image to *background*.
+
You can see that the image is represented by a small white square in the middle of the canvas.
+
[#img-image-added-to-canvas]
.The image is a small square in the middle of the canvas
image::image-added-to-canvas.png[]

. Select *background* in your Hierarchy view and with (most probably) your left hand, hold down all of CTRL SHIFT and ALT (Windows). Look at the background's *Rect Transform* panel and click on the *anchor presets icon*: image:anchor-presets-icon.png[]. Note that the graphic it displays changes depending on what it is currently set to, and may not be the same as the icon just referred to. 
+
[#img-anchor-presets-icon-location]
.The anchor presets dialog icon - it displays its current setting

+
The *anchor presets* dialog pops up:
+
[#img-anchor-presets]
.The anchor presets dialog
image::anchor-presets.png[]
. Click the bottom-right selection at the intersection of _stretch_ and _stretch_ (while still holding down CTRL SHIFT and ALT with the other hand): image:anchor-presets-icon.png[] ... this time there's no question that this is what you need to click!
+
The image stretches to fill the canvas, snapping the anchors to a full stretch.
+ The anchor presets dialog lets you build up a responsive geometry that will adjust as your application is viewed in many devices. But remember, it's not magic!
. Create an *Images* folder underneath your *Assets* folder in Unity, and download an image - any image - into it. This image is going to be the background of our first UI screen, so it would be good if its size and resolution matches that of your canvas.
+
TIP: *Unsplash* - https://unsplash.com/ - is a great place to find free images. That's where I got mine.
. Click the downloaded image within Unity and examine it in the Inspector. Make sure its *Texture Type* is set to *Sprite (2D and UI)*.
. Once more select the *background* in the Hierarchy view and drag your image from your *Assets* > *Images* folder into the *Source Image* slot of the background's *Image* compnent.
. Hit *2* on your keyboard - your canvas snaps into a 2D representation which will make things easier. This is OK even if your application is a 3D app.
. Find another image to represent, say, a logo - this time, it's not going to cover the whole screen so make it a smaller image. Make sure you place it in the *Assets* > *Image* folder and set its *Texture Type* to *Sprite (2D and UI)* in the inspector.
. Right-click on canvas again and choose *UI* > *Image* to add another child image - rename the image to *logo*. Drag the latest image from the *Asset* > *Images* folder into the *Source Image* slot of the *logo* as viewed in the Inspector.
. With the *logo* selected in the Hierarchy panel, open its anchor presets window and click the icon representing _center top_: image:center-top.png[]
+
This constrains the log to remain in the center at a fixed distance from the top, regardless of screen size. 
. In the inspector for the *logo* set its *Pos &* value to something reasonable - I set mine to -300.
. Right-click the canvas and choose *UI* > *Input Field - TextMeshPro* - rename it to *UserName*. Unity drops it onto the scene and you can open its anchor presets dialog in the Inspector, select *center top* and then adjust its *Pos Y* setting to something reasonable. Mine is set to -500.
