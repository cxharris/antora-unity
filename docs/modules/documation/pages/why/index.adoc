:navtitle: Why

Retired tech writer here, exploring the software I always wanted to play with but never had the time. It's all new to me, so I have to write things down to remember. Y'all must have heard of early-onset Alzheimer's, right? So, this site is a disorganised, illogical whack-a-mole across a bunch of stuff that just happens to catch my interest at a moment in time.

I've used Antora - https://antora.org/ - to build the site, simply because I've never used it before and I've long had a yearning to use Asciidoc for something larger than a toy project. What do I think of Antora? Ask me later, but one thing I've noticed is that there aren't many community-developed themes out there yet. What do I think of Asciidoc? I'm loving it - it's like a supercharged Markdown!

== Goal
If we only had a plan!
