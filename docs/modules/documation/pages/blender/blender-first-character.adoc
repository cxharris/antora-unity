= Our first character animation
:navtitle: First character

Gonna be honest here, what we'll end up with after a couple of hours work is not going to look pretty. It's certainly not what I set out to create when I decided to learn how to create animated characters in Blender. It's gonna be ugly and underwhelming. So ugly man. But with Blender, you can't get to the good stuff without experiencing some of the downright lousy stuff first. It's like a lot of fields in life - you can't run until you can walk! 

But there's a good side to all this. We'll learn some absolutely vital techniques when it comes to modeling characters - more shortcuts and more learned experiences that will stand us in good stead for leveling up quickly, and building characters that we can be proud of.

== Creating the barely-human character model

=== Modeling the head
. Let's start off with a new scene containing the default cube by choosing *File* > *New* > *General*.
. Hit *G* to grab the cube, and *Z* to constrain its movement to the Z-axis, then lift the cube up with your mouse to about 5m. When you've released the mouse, you can hit *N* and check the numbers in the transform to see if they make sense - adjust the *Z* value of the *Location* slot to 5m if it's wildly different.
. All the transformations occur with respect to the *origin point* - you can see it as an orange dot in the centre of the cube. But we might want our character to, say, nod its head, which means rotating about an origin that is a1t the bottom of the cube where the neck might be, not in the middle.
+
One way to move the origin from the centre to the neckline is:

* Press *NUMPAD 1* to enter *front orthographic* view - this is just to get a better view of what's going on. No need to do this when you're more practiced.
* Hit *Tab* to take the cube into edit mode, and press *A* to select all of its parts.
* Hit *G* to grab it and *Z* to constrain further movement to the Z-axis.
* Move the cube up with the mouse - you'll see that the origin point remains where it was, so you can now move the cube just enough for the origin point to be at the bottom of the cube, not the centre.
* Hit *Tab* again to get back to object mode - you can see the origin dot at the bottom of the cube.

+
Note the orange dot - the origin - is at the base of the head cube, not its centre, which is where it was placed to start by default. Adjusting the cube as we did messed up its height off the ground, but don't worry, we can fix that later.

=== Creating the body
. Hit *SHIFT - A* and choose *Mesh* > *Cube* to create a second cube at the world origin.
. Hit *G* and *Z* to bring the cube up to touch the head/first cube.
. Hit *S* to scale it down a little bit.
. Then *S* and *Z* to scale it down vertically a bit more, then *G* and *Z* to once more bring it into contact with the head.
+
[#img-blender-character-body]
.Our first shot at creating a body for our character
image::blender-character-body.png[]
+
We will make further adjustments to this body when we've seen how the character's arms match up to it.

=== Modeling the arms
. Let's start with another cube - but this time, instead of simply creating it, we'll duplicate the one we already have by selecting the body and hitting *SHIFT - D*. This is sometimes a little easier in *front orthographic* view - *NUMPAD 1*.
. Press *G* then *X* to bring the new arm out, so that it is next to the body, with a small gap.
. Press *S* and *X* to scale it on the X-axis, then *G* and *X* again to bring it back close to the body.
. In *right orthographic* view - *NUMPAD 3* - p ress *S* and *Y* to scale it on the Y-axis, to make it more like an arm - a narrow square column rather than the wider body.
. Press *G* and *Z* to bring it down a fraction.
. Fix the arm's pivot point so that it lies at the top, by entering edit mode, and using *G* *Z* to move the arm until the pivot point is correct. Finally, go back into object mode and use *G* *Z* again if necessary to bring it back up.
. In object mode, select the body and press *S* *Z* and make it a little longer - so that it's, say, one and a half arm lengths long, adjusting the position of the body with *G* *Z* so that it once again just contacts the head. 
. In object mode, hit *NUMPAD 1* to get back into *front orthographic* view, select the arm and press *SHIFT - D* and *X* to duplicate and move it to the corresponding position on the other side of the body.

.Adding arms to our character

+
You can see the origin point of the arm on the left (as we look at it) has been moved to the shoulder from the elbow, as we did in step 6.

=== Legs
. Select the body cube in object mode and press *SHIFT - D* and then *Z* to move a copy of the body below the original.s
. Hit *S* to scale it down and then *S* *X* to scale it on the X-axis and *S* *Y* to scale it on the Y-axis.
. Press *1* on the NUMPAD to go into front view, *G* to position it as, say, the left leg, and adjust the pivot so that it's at the top of the leg - recall that this happens in *edit* mode when you can press *G* and *Z* to move the leg independently of its pivot.
. Hit *SHIFT - D* to duplicate the leg, and *X* to move it to the mirror position of the first leg. If in doubt, press *NUMPAD 1* and make some gentle adjustments to ensure the two legs are symmetrical.

=== Final touches
. Select the head and hit *TAB* to go into edit mode, then *A* to select all parts of the head. 
. Press *CTRL - B*, drag the mouse *out* a little bit and see a *bevel* form. Click the left mouse to fix the bevel amount and notice a *Bevel* window has opened, offering us some parameters we might wish to apply to the operation. If you can't see it, you might have to open the window by clicking on its tab: image:blender-inline-bevel-button.png[].
+
A *bevel* is a geometric operation that adds vertices around edges so they are not as sharp. 
. Look at the *Bevel* window:
+
[#img-blender-bevel-window]
.The Bevel window
image::blender-bevel-window.png[]
+
The *Segments* setting determines the geometric complexity of the bevel - set it to *3* and see how the geometry changes on our character's head:
+
[#img-blender-character-bevel-head]
.Adding a bevel to the character's head
image::blender-character-bevel-head.png[]
+
. Repeatedly hit *CTRL Z* to return to the unbevelled head and hit *TAB* to get into object mode. Now that you know how to apply a bevel, we're going to apply a bevel to the whole model in one swoop. 
. Box-select the *whole model* in object mode and hit *TAB* to get into edit mode. 
. Hit *CTRL B* and once again move the mouse cursor away from the model (but don't click until you're ready) - you'll see bevels develop on all components of our character, click the left mouse to confirm the new bevels. If you get it wrong, remember *CTRL Z* is your friend!
+
[#img-blender-character-all-beveled]
.All beveled up
image::blender-character-all-beveled.png[]
. Back in object mode, left-click and drag to box-select the entire model, right-click and choose *Shade Smooth* - which applies some algorithms to make the edges and shadows render more smoothly. It makes the segments of our bevel operation less hard-edged and obvious.

As I said at the beginning, it's a little ugly but it's given us practice in building these kinds of models - and in fact, we should all feel confident that we could build many more similar models. Things won't begin to seem to tie together, however, until we understand how to _colour_ our models.

== Swapping out the grey
Our character is a bit bland at the moment - all in grey. Let's liven him up with some colour, and this is going to lead to us starting to understand a little about materials.

=== Adding colour to the character's head
. Select the head in object mode.
. Select the *material properties* icon on the *properties* window: 
+
[#img-blender-material-properties-icon]
.The location of the material properties icon
image:blender-material-properties-icon.png[]
+
The *properties window* fills with a bunch of complex-looking settings, but we're only going to focus on a couple of them at this stage - essentially, the properties window is displaying the properties of the default material assigned to the character's head.
+
The properties window contains two collapsible panels: *Preview* and *Surface* but it's *Surface* where all the action occurs.
. Observe that the *Surface* field in the *Surface* panel (ugh!) has an entry called *Principled BSDF*. If you click on it, you'll see that there are very many other options available, but a great deal of the time, *Principled BSDF* is going to be our choice, and it certainly is in this exercise.
+
Principled BSDF is the modern go-to material because using it, you can replicate the effects of many of those other options - it's quite a new feature (since version 2.79) and it's got the community quite excited. It's an _ubershader_ - and with a name like that, I'd just use it and move on if I were you.
. The next field is *Base Color* - click in the field and choose a colour for the character's head. When you do, notice that the colour of the model in the 3D view doesn't change.
+
This is because our viewport is displaying in *solid* mode, whereas what we're looking for is *material preview* mode. 
. Click the icon for *material preview* mode in the top-right of the 3d view:
+
[#img-blender-solid-material-preview-mode]
.Blender's solid and material preview viewport modes
image:blender-solid-material-preview-mode.png[]
+
Once you've selected material preview mode, our character's head is displayed in your chosen colour. It's a good idea to name your materials when you've created them, so click in the field where it says *Material.001* and change it to something more meaningful - I've named mine *CharacterPink*. 
+
Another way to get into material preview mode is simply to hit *Z* and choose your required render mode from the four options. The available options are accessible via numeric shortcuts if you prefer - just review their labels.z

=== Adding colour to the rest of our character's parts
. We have the head coloured, so how do we colour all the other character parts? There are two ways:
.. You can click on an element - say an arm - and then click the *down arrow* in the properties window to browse and select the colour you want:
+
[#img-blender-choose-material]
.Choosing a material to apply to another component
image:blender-choose-material.png[]
.. Alternatively, in object mode, you can box-select everything except the head, then *SHIFT CLICK* to select the head (notice that the last in a chain of selected objects is outlined in a lighter shade of orange), and hit *CTRL L* (link) and choose *Link Materials* - the head colour is propagated to all the other parts.
+
Notice also that in the *properties window* next to the name of the material is the number *6*. This means that the material is applied to six different 'users' or objects. If we changed the base colour, you would see that the colour of all objects changed, because of the linking. 
+
But what if in a scene with linked objects, we only want to change the colour of the head? Well, with the head selected, click the number (6 in our case) which unlinks just the head so that you can now recolour it on its own. In the jargon, we've made a 'single user' material for the head. If you do this, remember to give your new head colour a meaningful name.
+

.Changing just the colour of our character's head
image:blender-changing-head-colour.png[]
+
Now that we understand how to do this, let's revert back so that all of our character's parts are coloured the same.

=== Adding a floor for our character to stand on
Let's add a plane to create the illusion that our character is standing on the floor.
. Press *SHIFT A* and choose *Mesh* > *Plane*.
. Scale the plane in the *X* and *Y* directions to make it bigger - use techniques that you've already learned: *S* *X* and *S* *Y*.
. Move the plane in the *Z* direction using *G* *Z* and the mouse - position the plane just underneath our character's legs/feet. It's easier to do this in an orthographic view - use, say, *NUMPAD 1* to get there.
