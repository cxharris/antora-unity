| Shortcut | Meaning | Preconditions/notes

| A        | Select All | In edit mode, selects all components of an object when perhaps just one component (e.g. a vertex) might be selected
| ALT - A  | Deselect All | In edit mode, deselects the entirety of a selected object.
| E        | Extrude    | Extrude a face - by default along the face normal. In edit mode with a face selected.
| G        | Grab    | Grab/move a currently-selected entity. Works in object and edit mode
| G - X,Y,Z | Constrained grab | Constrain the grab to make the object move on the X, Y or Z axes respectively. Hitting SHIFT as well makes the move happen in smaller increments.
| MIDDLE MOUSE | Tumble | Tumble around a scene in object or edit mode  
| R        | Rotate    | Rotate a currently-selected entity about the 3D cursor (... possibly other options) in object or edit mode. It appears that the idea of rotating a single vertex is meaningless
| SCROLL WHEEL | Zoom  | Zoom into or out of the scene in object or edit mode
| SHIFT - MIDDLE MOUSE | Pan | Pan around a scene in the obect or edit mode
