== Launching and exploring Blender
. When you launch Blender for the first time, you get to see a dialog that asks you for some preferences - just accept the defaults from now and press *Next*.
. The next dialog offers you the opportunity to create a *New File* among other things. Click *General* underneath *New File* and Blender's initial launch screen appears:

Highlighted above, Blender's initial interface decomposes into five regions.

* The main window outlined in red which contains a camera, a lamp and a default cube is called the *3D view*. Most of our work happens here.
* The thin window at the bottom outlined in pink is the *timeline*, which allows you to animate objects through time.
* The window outlined in blue is called the *properties* window and it allows you to list many different properties of selected objects.
* The window outlined in green is called the *outliner* which displays a tree structure representing all objects in your scene.
* Outlined in yellow is the *header* which contains many menu options.

You don't have to stick with the default arrangement of windows - you can choose one of a number of *premade layouts* - they are offered in the header bar as options: *Layout* (default), *Modeling*, *Sculpting* and so on.

A drop-down in the top left of each true window allows you to replace the current window's contents with another - so, for exmaple, you could swap the timeline for the 3D view:

To maximize any single window, minimising others, just hover your mouse over it and press CTRL - SPACEBAR. CTRL - SPACBAR again restores everything to as it was.

The 3D view features a red line which is the X axis, and a green line for the Y axis.

== Manipulating the 3D view
First, it's best to mention that Blender in 3D works best with a three-button mouse. It's easier all round.

To *tumble* around your 3D view, just click your middle mouse button and drag around in the view. Another way to do it is to click and drag in Blender's gizmo area at the top right of the 3D view: image:blender-gizmo-area.png[].

To *zoom*, just use your scroll wheel.

Press SHIFT - MIDDLE MOUSE  to *pan* around the scene.

Hit *1* on your NUMPAD to flip to *front orthographic* view, *3* for *side orthographic* or *7* for *top orthographic* view. Hit *CTRL* and then *1*, *3* or *7* and it will flip to *left*, *back* and *bottom* respectively. Tumble out of any of these views to return to the *perspective* view. Click on the dots in the gizmo area to perform equivalent actions. The patterns take a little practice, but if this is preferable to the NUMPAD for you, you'll soon get used to it.

If you're in an orthographic view, you can hit NUMPAD *2*, *4*, *6* and *8* to rotate in increments around your view.

In the 3D view, you can see the camera:

[#img-blende-camera]
.Blender's initial camera

You can click on it to select it - it aquires an eerie orange contour. Hit *0* on the NUMPAD to go into camera view, where the 3D view flips to present what the camera is seeing.  This is the view that represents your renders or animations. As always, you can escape from a view by middle-button-rotating.

== Manipulating objects in the 3D view
In the world of direct manipulation in Blender, shortcut keys are a way of life.

To *select* an object, just left-click it and its edges usually change colour to a nice orange. I know this sounds kinda trivial, but earlier versions of Blender used a default *right-click* for selection. Apparently, there are a couple of genuine UX advantages to this, but it seems to me they must have been swamped by the disadvantage of having to remember special Blender rules above and beyond all the other time-honoured conventions of software. Anyway, it's now *left-click*.

To move an object, hit the *G* key when it's selected - this grabs the object for you to place elsewhere. *G* is apparently the shortcut key for *Grab*. You can grab things like lights and cameras, as well as objects like cubes and spheres. But I know we haven't done spheres yet. When you left-click a grabbed object, it's dropped in a new location. While an object is grabbed, you can hit X, Y or Z to constrain movement to one of those specific axes. If we do this - hit *G* then an axis, we can also type in a displacement along the axis along which the cube will move.

You can also move an object using the *tools* menu in the top-left of the 3D view. If it's not visible, hit the *T* key.

[#img-blender-tools]
.Manipulation tools
image::blender-tools.png[]

We may well explore more of these tools at some stage, but for now, check out the third one down - it's a *move* manipulator. Click it (with the cube  selected) and the cube acquires some *move manpulators* which let you move it along the X, Y or Z axes.

[#img-blender-move-manipulators]
.Move manipulators
image::blender-move-manipulator.png[]

Hitting *G* and pressing SHIFT - X, allows movement on all axes except X, and the same pattern applies for all the other axes.

Just below *move* on the manipulation tools menu is *rotate*. If you select the cube and click *rotate*, the *rotate manipulators* appear.

[#img-blender-rotate-manipulators]
.Rotate manipulators
image::blender-rotate-manipulators.png[]

Click on the red, green or blue arcs to rotate the cube around the corresponding axes. If you get it wrong, CTRL - Z undoes your last action.

Instead of using the widget, we can also hit *R* to rotate, which allows you to rotate in the perspective you're in. After hitting *R* you can press *X*, *Y* or *Z* to constrain the rotation appropriately - very useful! Hitting any of these R-axis combinations activates a message in the top left telling you how many degrees you've rotated about which axis. We can also provide input when in this mode - type *45* on your keyboard, and it will rotate 45 degrees.

Next manipulator down in the menu is *scaling*. Once again, handles appear that let you scale the object, or we can hit *S* and then an axis to constrain scaling along that axis. Like the other operatins, sequences like *S*, *Y*, *3* scale an object 3 units on the Y axis.

Hit the *N* key with an object selected, and a menu pops up that lets you specify translation/rotation/scale directly and accurately.

*ALT-R* clears any rotation, *ALT-G* clears any movement and *ALT-S* any scaling. Somehow though, these commands have been entangled with my graphic card settings that insist on popping up whenever I type *ALT-R*. Sucks.

Hit *CTRL-A* to *apply* various operations to the object. Once applied, the current state of the property becomes the default. So *CTRL-A* > *Rotation* makes the current rotation the default, 'zero' rotation. Doing this of course nullifies what *ALT-R*, *ALT-G* and *ALT-S* might have done, because there's now nothing to 'clear' - we're at 'zero'.
