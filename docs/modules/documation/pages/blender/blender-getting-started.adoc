== Launching and exploring Blender
. When you launch Blender for the first time, you get to see a dialog that asks you for some preferences - just accept the defaults from now and press *Next*.
. The next dialog offers you the opportunity to create a *New File* among other things. Click *General* underneath *New File* and Blender's initial launch screen appears:

Highlighted above, Blender's initial interface decomposes into five regions.

* The main window outlined in red which contains a camera, a lamp and a default cube is called the *3D view*. Most of our work happens here.
* The thin window at the bottom outlined in pink is the *timeline*, which allows you to animate objects through time.
* The window outlined in blue is called the *properties* window and it allows you to list many different properties of selected objects.
* The window outlined in green is called the *outliner* which displays a tree structure representing all objects in your scene.
* Outlined in yellow is the *header* which contains many menu options.

You don't have to stick with the default arrangement of windows - you can choose one of a number of *premade layouts* - they are offered in the header bar as options: *Layout* (default), *Modeling*, *Sculpting* and so on.

A drop-down in the top left of each true window allows you to replace the current window's contents with another - so, for exmaple, you could swap the timeline for the 3D view:

To maximize any single window, minimising others, just hover your mouse over it and press CTRL - SPACEBAR. CTRL - SPACBAR again restores everything to as it was.

The 3D view features a red line which is the X axis, and a green line for the Y axis.
