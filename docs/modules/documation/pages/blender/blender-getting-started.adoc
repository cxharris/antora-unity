== Launching and exploring Blender
. When you launch Blender for the first time, you get to see a dialog that asks you for some preferences - just accept the defaults from now and press *Next*.
. The next dialog offers you the opportunity to create a *New File* among other things. Click *General* underneath *New File* and Blender's initial launch screen appears:

Highlighted above, Blender's initial interface decomposes into five regions.

* The main window outlined in red which contains a camera, a lamp and a default cube is called the *3D view*. Most of our work happens here.
* The thin window at the bottom outlined in pink is the *timeline*, which allows you to animate objects through time.
* The window outlined in blue is called the *properties* window and it allows you to list many different properties of selected objects.
* The window outlined in green is called the *outliner* which displays a tree structure representing all objects in your scene.
* Outlined in yellow is the *header* which contains many menu options.

You don't have to stick with the default arrangement of windows - you can choose one of a number of *premade layouts* - they are offered in the header bar as options: *Layout* (default), *Modeling*, *Sculpting* and so on.

A drop-down in the top left of each true window allows you to replace the current window's contents with another - so, for exmaple, you could swap the timeline for the 3D view:

To maximize any single window, minimising others, just hover your mouse over it and press CTRL - SPACEBAR. CTRL - SPACBAR again restores everything to as it was.

The 3D view features a red line which is the X axis, and a green line for the Y axis.

== Manipulating the 3D view
First, it's best to mention that Blender in 3D works best with a three-button mouse. It's easier all round.

To *tumble* around your 3D view, just click your middle mouse button and drag around in the view. Another way to do it is to click and drag in Blender's gizmo area at the top right of the 3D view: image:blender-gizmo-area.png[].

To *zoom*, just use your scroll wheel.

Press SHIFT - MIDDLE MOUSE  to *pan* around the scene.

Hit *1* on your NUMPAD to flip to *front orthographic* view, *3* for *side orthographic* or *7* for *top orthographic* view. Hit *CTRL* and then *1*, *3* or *7* and it will flip to *left*, *back* and *bottom* respectively. Tumble out of any of these views to return to the *perspective* view. Click on the dots in the gizmo area to perform equivalent actions. The patterns take a little practice, but if this is preferable to the NUMPAD for you, you'll soon get used to it.

If you're in an orthographic view, you can hit NUMPAD *2*, *4*, *6* and *8* to rotate in increments around your view.

In the 3D view, you can see the camera:

[#img-blende-camera]
.Blender's initial camera

You can click on it to select it, when it aquires an orange contour. Hit *0* on the NUMPAD to go into camera view, where the 3D view flips to present what the camera is seeing.  This is the view that represents your renders or animations. As always, you can escape from a view by middle-button-rotating.
