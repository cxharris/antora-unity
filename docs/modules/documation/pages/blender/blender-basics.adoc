:navtitle: Blender

Blender - available at https://blender.org - is a super and free 3D modelling and animation tool. It can also export assets in a form that Unity can consume, which is a frequently used workflow.

I'm using version 3.1 but would be surprised if these exercises didn't work for earlier versions.
